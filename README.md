# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

This project is aimed at sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) task that predicts whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The project employs the Naive Bayes classifier to achieve this task, achieving an accuracy of 73% on the dataset used.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in understanding the opinions and emotions expressed in textual data. This project focuses on building a predictive model that can classify text into positive or negative sentiment categories.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the textual data for analysis.
- **Data Representation:** Utilizing the Bag of Words (BoW) approach, the textual data is represented in a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Model:** The sentiment analysis model is implemented using the Naive Bayes algorithm, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.
- **Accuracy:** The model achieves an accuracy of 73% on the dataset used for training and evaluation.

## Libraries Used

The project relies on several Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and text processing:

- **NumPy:** For numerical computing and array operations.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization and plotting.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn):** For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **re:** For regular expressions, used in text preprocessing.
- **NLTK:** Natural Language Toolkit, utilized for various text processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
